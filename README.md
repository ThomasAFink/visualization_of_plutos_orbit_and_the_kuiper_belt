# Visualization of Pluto's Orbit and the Kuiper Belt

This Python script provides a detailed visualization of the orbital paths of the major planets in our solar system, with a special focus on Pluto and its relationship with the Kuiper Belt. Utilizing `numpy` for mathematical calculations and `matplotlib` for plotting, the script generates a comprehensive diagram showing the orbits of the planets, Pluto's elliptical orbit, and the scattered distribution of the Kuiper Belt.

## Getting Started

To run this script, you need Python installed on your system along with the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries. These dependencies can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
